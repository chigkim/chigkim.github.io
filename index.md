# Chi Gook Kim

I'm an Associate Professor in the [Music Therapy Department at Berklee College of Music](https://college.berklee.edu/music-therapy) and founder of [Assistive Music Technology Lab](https://college.berklee.edu/assistive-music-technology).

My work focuses on building tools and curricula that enable blind and visually impaired musicians to participate effectively in the music industry.

I am also an open-source developer. My tools, including [VOCR](https://github.com/chigkim/VOCR) and [Flo Tools](https://github.com/flotools/flotools), are used by blind and visually impaired musicians worldwide.
