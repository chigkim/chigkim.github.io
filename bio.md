Chi Gook Kim is an associate professor in the [Music Therapy Department at Berklee College of Music](https://college.berklee.edu/music-therapy), where he leads the [Assistive Music Technology Lab](https://college.berklee.edu/assistive-music-technology). Since founding the program in 2010, he has worked to fully integrate blind and visually impaired students into the Berklee experience through accessible technology, innovative curriculum, and cross campus collaboration. His mission is to ensure that students with visual impairments have the same opportunities as their sighted peers, both during their education and as they enter professional careers in music.

Within the Assistive Music Technology program, Chi teaches audio recording and production, digital music notation, music scoring, and Braille music. He equips students with the technical and creative skills required in contemporary music careers while also addressing the accessibility barriers that have historically limited full participation in the industry. Beyond the classroom, he collaborates with faculty, staff, and departments across Berklee to advance accessibility, universal design, and inclusive practices throughout the institution.

Chi is widely recognized for his work in developing practical tools that expand access to professional music software. He created Flo Tools, an open source project which significantly enhances workflow for screen reader users working in Pro Tools. He developed VOCR, a machine learning based optical character recognition tool that enables VoiceOver users to navigate otherwise inaccessible Mac applications. He has also led efforts to improve the accessibility of Sibelius, one of the leading digital notation platforms, enabling musicians with visual impairments to use the software more efficiently and independently.

His work has been featured in the Boston Globe, The Chronicle of Higher Education, Mix Magazine, and at the NAMM Show. His life story has been the focus of Talks at Google and two documentary films broadcast on KBS, one of South Korea’s major television networks. Internationally recognized as an expert in assistive music technology, he consults with universities, organizations, and technology companies to promote accessibility and expand opportunities for blind and visually impaired musicians worldwide.

In addition to his academic work, he serves as Chief Technology Officer and Producer at Serotonics Music, and his music was featured in various media, including TV documentaries, films, and games. He holds a Bachelor of Music in Songwriting and Contemporary Writing and Production from Berklee College of Music and a Master of Music in Music Technology from New York University.
