VOCR is a free, open-source macOS application that makes inaccessible on-screen content usable with VoiceOver by combining OCR with AI-powered image analysis. It lets blind and visually impaired users read graphics-heavy interfaces, video subtitles, and any content VoiceOver cannot access on its own, using keyboard shortcuts that work from anywhere in macOS. Features include OCR of current window, an Ask AI mode that sends screen images to a vision language model, real-time OCR for live captions, AI-driven screen region exploration, and camera capture.
