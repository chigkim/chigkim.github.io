VOLlama is a free, open-source chat client that makes large language models accessible to screen reader users. It supports both macOS and Windows. Features include a keyboard-navigable chat interface, automatic text-to-speech via screen readers, SAPI, or NSSpeechSynthesizer, multimodal image attachment for vision-capable models, retrieval-augmented generation from local documents and URLs using LlamaIndex, and customizable parameters such as temperature and context window size.
