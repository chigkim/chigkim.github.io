AME (Accessible Markdown Editor) is a free, open-source Markdown editor built for screen reader users that keeps the interface simple and fully keyboard-accessible. Writers can switch between a Markdown source view and a rendered HTML preview, export their work to an HTML file, or copy the rendered HTML to the clipboard. The editor supports extended Markdown syntax including tables, footnotes, and fenced code blocks.
