Flo Tools is a free, open-source accessibility tool for Avid Pro Tools. It is used by blind and visually impaired audio engineers, students, and musicians around the world. It provides keyboard-driven workflows via Keyboard Maestro and VoiceOver UI scripts, translating common Pro Tools operations into accessible keyboard commands for one of the industry's most widely used digital audio workstations.
