AI SimBot is a free, open-source educational platform that uses AI to create realistic communication simulations for professional training. It was originally developed to help nursing students at Northeastern University practice the CRAFFT screening tool. Learners interact with a simulated patient via text or voice, powered by OpenAI's Whisper for speech recognition and OpenAI TTS for output, and receive immediate structured feedback on their performance. Scenarios are fully customizable by editing the prompts that defines the AI's role, persona, and interaction structure, making the tool adaptable to any discipline. Built on Streamlit and the OpenAI API, it requires only an OpenAI API key and a forked repository to run.
