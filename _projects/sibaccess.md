SibAccess is a free, accessible tutorial series for blind and visually impaired musicians learning Sibelius notation software with screen readers. It spans three progressively advanced parts, guiding users from basic score navigation and note input through lyrics, chord symbols, drum notation, repeat structures, and file export. It covers all the basics needed to compose and produce scores independently.
